In React Native, when using a FlatList to render a large number of items, you might encounter performance issues if you're not careful with how you manage the data and rendering process.  One such issue involves not properly using `keyExtractor` with `FlatList`.  If this is missing or incorrectly implemented, React Native might not efficiently update the list, leading to slow rendering, unexpected behavior, or even crashes.

Example of an incorrect implementation:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <MyComponent item={item} />}
/>
```

This lacks a `keyExtractor`.  React Native struggles to identify and update individual items efficiently when keys are missing or duplicate.
