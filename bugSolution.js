The solution involves adding a `keyExtractor` prop to your `FlatList` component. This prop should be a function that returns a unique key for each item in your data array. Here's how you can fix the previous example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => item.id || index.toString()}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <MyComponent item={item} />}
/>
```

This improved version uses the `id` property of each item as the key. If the item doesn't have an `id` property, it uses the index as a fallback.  Make sure to use a field that uniquely identifies every element in your data, or a combination of fields if necessary to guarantee uniqueness. Using the index as a key is generally discouraged unless your data is truly static.
